//write a function that takes an array of coins, and a string representing a coin. Options to the strings in the array, and the the string representing a coin are restricted to: penny, nickel, dime, quarter, half dollar, and dollar.

//This function will output how many of the second argument (the string) it would take to cover the total value of all of the coins in the array.
//
//Tests:
//
//`coverValue(["penny", "nickel", "dime"], "quarter") // -> 1`
//`coverValue(["penny", "nickel", "dime"], "nickel") // -> 4`
//`coverValue(["penny", "nickel", "dime", "dime", "quarter"], "dime")`
